# Auto Shutdown
This program shut down the computer in 300s after started

The idea is to add this program to the computer tasks (taskschd.msc) so it can start automatically at a certain hour

# Rename Random

When running this, the idea is to rename files in one, or various folders

The new files name will be random, actually 8 random characters, for example, I have the file test1.jpg the file will be named aHtw4FG9.jpg

```
python rename_random.py folder_with_files1
python rename_random.py folder_with_files1 folder_with_files2 folder_with_files2 folder_with_files3 (...)
```
